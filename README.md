__NOTE__: The app is still unfinished and will be completed with a "Favorites" page and other features (back-end will be changed and I will use Node.js, include Redux, clean the code, etc).

<ins>Description:</ins>

Full Stack e-commerce platform. Users can register an account and sign in.
The sign-in/up form can check password validity and the login button is disabled until a valid password is entered.
