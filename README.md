Description:
Full Stack e-commerce platform. Users can register an account and sign in.
The sign-in/up form can check password validity and the login button is disabled until a valid password is entered.

All albums data are hosted on the Firebase Realtime Database server, retrieved from there and then shown on the webpage.

When an order is submitted it gets registered on the server.
NOTE: The app is still unfinished and will be completed with a "Favorites" page and more back-end features.
